# Volley Llama

The team app for **AYTC-Volley Llama-Mendez**, a USTA 3.0 mixed doubles team
(Fall 2026). Players check the schedule and say whether they can play; captains
build lineups, post them, and enter results.

Built with React + Vite, Supabase, and Netlify.

## Features

**For players**

- **Home**: the next match, whether you're in the lineup, and a one-tap availability picker.
- **Schedule**: every match with time, site, and home/away. Answer *Available / Maybe / Out* right from the list.
- **Stats**: team record, results by court, a player leaderboard, best partnerships, and each player's match log.
- No accounts. Pick your name once; update your details any time from **Stats → Edit my details**.

**For captains**

- Availability counts split by gender (every lineup needs three men and three women). Tap a count to see who.
- A red **!** on any upcoming match that doesn't have enough yeses to field a lineup.
- A lineup builder for three courts (one man and one woman each) that flags maybes, no-answers, dropouts, and any pair over the **6.0 combined NTRP** limit.
- **Auto-suggest**, which drafts a legal lineup and explains its choices. See [Lineups](#lineups).
- Post the lineup to the team, copy it as a group text, send a nudge to anyone who hasn't answered, enter scores, and edit match details.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juice-lee/volley-llama.git
cd volley-llama
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in the two Supabase values
npm run dev
```

The Supabase values aren't in the repository; ask Kevin for them. Git ignores
`.env.local`, so they never get committed.

Vite prints the local URL (usually http://localhost:5173). The first screen asks
for the team password, which is `TEAM_KEY` in `src/lib/identity.js`.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Build for production into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Lint with oxlint |

> [!WARNING]
> **Local development uses the live database.** There is no staging environment,
> so anything you do in `npm run dev`, such as setting availability, changes real
> team data. Captain actions still require the passcode.

## How it works

### Access

There are no user accounts, just three layers:

| Layer | What it does | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| **Team password** | Keeps out anyone who stumbles on the URL. Client-side only, by design. A link ending in `?key=<password>` unlocks the app and then removes the key from the address bar. | `TEAM_KEY` in `src/lib/identity.js` |
| **Player identity** | Each player picks their name once, and the device remembers it. | `localStorage` |
| **Captain passcode** | Required for every lineup, result, and match edit. Checked inside Postgres against a SHA-256 hash that the browser can never read. | `usta_config` table and the `usta_*` database functions |

Anyone with the link can set availability. That's deliberate, so nobody needs a login.

### Data

Everything lives in Supabase, in tables prefixed `usta_`.

| Table | Contents |
|---|---|
| `usta_players` | Roster: USTA name, preferred name, gender, NTRP, USTA number, phone, Venmo, captain flag |
| `usta_matches` | Each match: time, home/away, opponent, site, team note, whether the lineup is posted |
| `usta_availability` | One row per player per match: `available`, `maybe`, or `out` |
| `usta_lineups` | One row per match per court: the pair, `won`, and `score` |
| `usta_config` | The captain passcode hash (no browser access) |

- **Every statistic comes from `usta_lineups`**: play counts, records, partnerships,
  and court history. Entering scores after each match is the only upkeep. A lineup
  counts toward play totals once the match starts or the lineup is posted; a draft
  for a future match doesn't.
- **Changes sync live.** Availability, lineups, and match edits update on every open
  phone through Supabase Realtime.
- **Names:** `usta_players.name` is the official USTA roster name. The app shows
  `preferred_name` when one is set, through `displayName()` in `src/components/ui.jsx`.

### Match phases

A single function, `matchPhase()` in `src/lib/dates.js`, decides whether a match is
**upcoming**, **live**, or **past**, so every screen agrees. It re-checks when a
phone wakes up or the tab regains focus. All times are Pacific.

### Lineups

Three courts, each with one man and one woman. Two rules shape every lineup:

- **Each court may total at most 6.0 NTRP.** `pairOverCap()` in `src/lib/rules.js`
  is the single source of truth, used by the court cards, slot picker, problems
  list, and the confirmation before posting. Players without a rating are never
  flagged.
- **Availability counts are split by gender, never totaled.** Seven yeses can still
  mean there aren't three women.

**Auto-suggest** (`src/lib/suggest.js`) tries every combination of available
players and picks the best one by these priorities, in order:

1. **Legal.** It never seats a pair over 6.0. If that means swapping someone in or
   leaving the bottom court open, it says so.
2. **Who most needs to play.** Yeses before maybes, then the fewest other chances
   this season, then the fewest matches played.
3. **Where each pair plays.** Pairs with a winning record stay together, a win moves
   a player up a court and a loss moves them down, and NTRP breaks ties.

The suggestion fills the draft so the captain can review it before saving.

## Captain operations

**Unlock captain tools.** Go to the Stats tab → **Captain tools** and enter the
passcode. Players marked as captains on the roster also see a Captain tab. Each
device remembers the passcode once entered.

**Reschedule a match.** Captain → the match → **Match details → Edit** lets you
change the date, site, and team note. No deploy needed.

**Add a player.** There's no screen for this yet. Run this in the Supabase SQL
editor; the app picks it up on the next load, no deploy needed.

```sql
insert into public.usta_players (name, gender, ntrp, usta_number, phone, sort_order)
values ('First Last', 'F', 3.0, '2019000000', '206-555-0100',
        (select coalesce(max(sort_order), 0) + 1 from public.usta_players));
```

**Change the captain passcode.** Run this in the Supabase SQL editor, and pick
something random, since the check allows unlimited guesses.

```sql
select public.usta_set_captain_pass('current-passcode', 'new-passcode');
```

**Change the team password.** Edit `TEAM_KEY` in `src/lib/identity.js` (keep it
lowercase), then deploy.

## Deploying

The site is hosted on Netlify. Deploys are manual, from a machine that has
`.env.local` filled in and is logged in to the Netlify CLI:

```bash
netlify link          # once per clone
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --no-build --dir=dist
```

The repository is deliberately not connected to Netlify's automatic deploys, so
pushing doesn't use up build credits. Only code changes need a deploy; roster,
schedule, and availability changes are data and show up immediately.

## Contributing

1. Create a branch: `git switch -c short-description`
2. Before pushing, run `npm run lint` and `npm run build`
3. Open a pull request against `main`
4. Kevin reviews, merges, and deploys

Remember that local development writes to the live database.

## Gotchas

- **Overlays must render into `document.body`.** Page transitions animate `transform`
  on the `.page` wrapper, which breaks `position: fixed` for anything inside it.
  `Sheet` and `Toast` in `src/components/ui.jsx` use a portal for this reason; do the
  same for any new overlay.
- **iPhones clear site data after about a week without a visit** (apps added to the
  home screen are exempt). A player who hasn't opened the app in a while may see the
  password and name screens again. Sending the `?key=` link makes that painless.
- **The splash animation plays once per browser session** and waits for data (up to
  4.5 seconds). Open a new tab or run `sessionStorage.clear()` to see it again. Its
  animation steps share one timing, so retime them together.
- **Motion is turned off** for anyone with *Reduce motion* enabled, splash included.
- **`supabase-setup.sql` is behind the live database.** It doesn't yet include the
  `preferred_name` and `venmo` columns or the `usta_update_profile` function.
